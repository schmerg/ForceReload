This is the source for the ForceReload extension for Google Chrome as
available to install at

  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkhgjeaffbhdcpflajldaijabgclfnoa#

As you'll see, this is minimal extension but I've published the source
so people can seea working extension with not much code, but a toolbar
button, options, the manifest files etc

I made the zip files for each version by hand and include them here as
that's how you deploy projects to the Chrome Web Store

The icons are sourced from the excellent
  http://code.google.com/p/ultimate-gnome/
and are used subject to the  license there

The icons in that project are made available under the GPLv2 license
so I'm going to likewise say

  This work is published under a GPL v2 license

There's so little code it might seem daft to consider the license, but
I appreciate the effort newmooon has put into the icons so it's mostly
to protect his work.
